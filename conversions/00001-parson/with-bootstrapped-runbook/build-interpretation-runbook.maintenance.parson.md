# Build Interpretation Runbook Maintenance - Parson Project Analysis

After analyzing the three build systems (Makefile, CMake, and Meson) in the Parson JSON library project, the existing interpretation runbooks sufficiently cover all build constructs encountered during this assessment.

## Analysis Summary

The Parson project build systems were successfully analyzed using the existing interpretation patterns from:
- `build-interpretation-runbook.make.md`
- `build-interpretation-runbook.cmake.md` 
- `build-interpretation-runbook.meson.md`

All build constructs found in the project were adequately covered by existing interpretation patterns, with appropriate reference tags applied in the build assessment documents.

## Notable Pattern Applications

### Makefile Build System
- All patterns from compiler configuration to test execution were well-covered
- The selective cleanup pattern [IP-MAKE-MAINTENANCE-001] appropriately identified the incomplete cleanup behavior where only `test` and `*.o` files are removed while `testcpp` and `test_hash_collisions` executables remain

### CMake Build System
- Modern CMake patterns for library packaging and installation were fully covered
- Generator expressions and export configurations matched existing interpretation patterns

### Meson Build System
- All project configuration, target definition, and package integration patterns were adequately addressed
- Dependency declaration and pkg-config generation patterns aligned with existing runbook content

## Recommendation

No new interpretation patterns or runbook updates are needed based on this project analysis. The existing interpretation runbooks provide comprehensive coverage for the build system constructs encountered in the Parson JSON library project.
