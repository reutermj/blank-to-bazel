# Build Assessment - Parson Project - CMake

This document provides a comprehensive assessment of the CMake build system for the Parson JSON library project.

## Basic Project Structure

### [BAP-CMAKE-STRUCTURE-001] CMake Version Requirement
- **Description**: Establishes the minimum CMake version required to build the project. The requirement for CMake 3.5 indicates the build system uses features introduced in that version and ensures compatibility with older build environments while accessing necessary CMake functionality.

- **Source Code Snippet**:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
```

- **Path to Source File**: CMakeLists.txt
- **Line Number in Source File**: 1
- **References**: [IP-CMAKE-STRUCTURE-001]

### [BAP-CMAKE-STRUCTURE-002] Project Declaration
- **Description**: Establishes the fundamental project identity with the name "parson" and specifies C as the primary programming language. This declaration enables CMake's C language support and establishes the project context for all subsequent build configuration.

- **Source Code Snippet**:
```cmake
project(parson C)
```

- **Path to Source File**: CMakeLists.txt
- **Line Number in Source File**: 2
- **References**: [IP-CMAKE-STRUCTURE-002]

### [BAP-CMAKE-STRUCTURE-003] Standard Module Inclusion
- **Description**: Incorporates the GNUInstallDirs module to provide standard installation directory variables. This inclusion enables the use of CMAKE_INSTALL_* variables for portable installation paths that follow GNU/Linux conventions while remaining cross-platform compatible.

- **Source Code Snippet**:
```cmake
include (GNUInstallDirs)
```

- **Path to Source File**: CMakeLists.txt
- **Line Number in Source File**: 4
- **References**: [IP-CMAKE-STRUCTURE-003]

### [BAP-CMAKE-STRUCTURE-004] Centralized Version Management
- **Description**: Establishes the project version (1.5.3) in a centralized variable for reuse across multiple build components. This pattern ensures version consistency across target properties and eliminates version maintenance issues by providing a single source of truth for version information.

- **Source Code Snippet**:
```cmake
set(PARSON_VERSION 1.5.3)
```

- **Path to Source File**: CMakeLists.txt
- **Line Number in Source File**: 6
- **References**: [IP-CMAKE-STRUCTURE-004]

## Target Definition

### [BAP-CMAKE-TARGET-001] Basic Library Target Declaration
- **Description**: Creates the primary library target "parson" with parson.c as the single source file. This establishes the core library build target that compiles the JSON parsing functionality into a library that can be linked by other projects.

- **Source Code Snippet**:
```cmake
add_library(parson parson.c)
```

- **Path to Source File**: CMakeLists.txt
- **Line Number in Source File**: 7
- **References**: [IP-CMAKE-TARGET-001]

### [BAP-CMAKE-TARGET-002] Public Include Directory Configuration
- **Description**: Configures the library to provide its headers to consuming projects in the "include" directory when installed. The generator expression ensures that downstream projects can find the headers in the correct location after installation, enabling proper library consumption through find_package().

- **Source Code Snippet**:
```cmake
target_include_directories(parson PUBLIC $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>)
```

- **Path to Source File**: CMakeLists.txt
- **Line Number in Source File**: 8
- **References**: [IP-CMAKE-TARGET-002]

### [BAP-CMAKE-TARGET-003] Public Header Designation
- **Description**: Designates parson.h as the public header file for the library target. This configuration enables automatic installation of the header file when the target is installed and identifies which headers comprise the public API for downstream projects.

- **Source Code Snippet**:
```cmake
set_target_properties(parson PROPERTIES PUBLIC_HEADER "parson.h")
```

- **Path to Source File**: CMakeLists.txt
- **Line Number in Source File**: 10
- **References**: [IP-CMAKE-TARGET-003]

### [BAP-CMAKE-TARGET-004] Library Version Configuration
- **Description**: Sets the complete version information (1.5.3) for the library target using the centralized version variable. This establishes the full version string used for library identification, compatibility tracking, and package management.

- **Source Code Snippet**:
```cmake
set_target_properties(parson PROPERTIES VERSION ${PARSON_VERSION})
```

- **Path to Source File**: CMakeLists.txt
- **Line Number in Source File**: 11
- **References**: [IP-CMAKE-TARGET-004]

### [BAP-CMAKE-TARGET-005] Shared Library ABI Version
- **Description**: Sets the ABI (Application Binary Interface) version to match the full project version (1.5.3). This configuration establishes binary compatibility versioning for shared libraries, indicating that the full version number is used for ABI compatibility determination rather than just the major version.

- **Source Code Snippet**:
```cmake
set_target_properties(parson PROPERTIES SOVERSION ${PARSON_VERSION})
```

- **Path to Source File**: CMakeLists.txt
- **Line Number in Source File**: 12
- **References**: [IP-CMAKE-TARGET-005]

## Installation Configuration

### [BAP-CMAKE-INSTALL-001] Comprehensive Installation Rules
- **Description**: Defines complete installation rules that handle all library components including runtime binaries, shared libraries, static archives, and public headers. The configuration uses standard GNU installation directories and creates an export target for downstream consumption. The COMPONENT specification for runtime destinations enables granular package management.

- **Source Code Snippet**:
```cmake
install(
    TARGETS parson
    EXPORT parsonTargets
    RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR} COMPONENT shlib
    LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
    ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
    PUBLIC_HEADER DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}
)
```

- **Path to Source File**: CMakeLists.txt
- **Line Number in Source File**: 14-21
- **References**: [IP-CMAKE-INSTALL-001]

### [BAP-CMAKE-INSTALL-002] Package Export Configuration
- **Description**: Creates CMake package configuration files that enable downstream projects to use find_package(parson) for library discovery and consumption. The configuration file is named parsonConfig.cmake and includes the parson:: namespace prefix for imported targets, following modern CMake best practices for package consumption.

- **Source Code Snippet**:
```cmake
install(
    EXPORT parsonTargets
    FILE parsonConfig.cmake
    NAMESPACE parson::
    DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/cmake/${PROJECT_NAME}
)
```

- **Path to Source File**: CMakeLists.txt
- **Line Number in Source File**: 23-28
- **References**: [IP-CMAKE-INSTALL-002]
