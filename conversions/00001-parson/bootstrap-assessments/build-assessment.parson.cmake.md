# Build Assessment - Parson CMake Build System

## Project Overview
This assessment analyzes the CMake build system for the Parson JSON library project. Parson is a lightweight JSON parsing library written in C that provides a simple API for JSON manipulation.

## Build System Structure

### Project Configuration
**Reference Pattern**: [PROPOSED-IP-CMAKE-001]
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(parson C)
```

The build system establishes basic project metadata, specifying this as a C language project named "parson" with a minimum CMake version requirement of 3.5. This indicates a focus on maintaining compatibility with older CMake installations while leveraging essential modern CMake features.

### Module Inclusion
**Reference Pattern**: [PROPOSED-IP-CMAKE-002]
```cmake
include (GNUInstallDirs)
```

The build system incorporates the GNUInstallDirs module to provide standardized installation directory variables that follow GNU conventions. This ensures the library installs to appropriate system locations across different Unix-like platforms.

### Version Management
**Reference Pattern**: [PROPOSED-IP-CMAKE-003]
```cmake
set(PARSON_VERSION 1.5.3)
```

A centralized version variable is established to maintain consistency across the build system. This variable is referenced in multiple target properties to ensure version information remains synchronized.

### Library Target Definition
**Reference Pattern**: [PROPOSED-IP-CMAKE-004]
```cmake
add_library(parson parson.c)
target_include_directories(parson PUBLIC $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>)
```

The core library target is defined using a single source file (parson.c). The public include directory is configured using a generator expression to specify that consumers should use the "include" directory when the library is installed, enabling proper header discovery for downstream projects.

### Target Properties Configuration
**Reference Pattern**: [PROPOSED-IP-CMAKE-005]
```cmake
set_target_properties(parson PROPERTIES PUBLIC_HEADER "parson.h")
set_target_properties(parson PROPERTIES VERSION ${PARSON_VERSION})
set_target_properties(parson PROPERTIES SOVERSION ${PARSON_VERSION})
```

The build system configures essential library properties:
- Designates parson.h as the public header for installation
- Sets the library version for shared library versioning
- Sets the SOVERSION (shared object version) to maintain ABI compatibility tracking

### Installation Configuration
**Reference Pattern**: [PROPOSED-IP-CMAKE-006]
```cmake
install(
    TARGETS parson
    EXPORT parsonTargets
    RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR} COMPONENT shlib
    LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
    ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
    PUBLIC_HEADER DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}
)
```

The build system defines a comprehensive installation rule that:
- Installs runtime components (executables/DLLs) to the binary directory
- Installs shared libraries to the library directory
- Installs static archives to the library directory
- Installs public headers to the include directory
- Exports target information for downstream consumption

### Export Configuration
**Reference Pattern**: [PROPOSED-IP-CMAKE-007]
```cmake
install(
    EXPORT parsonTargets
    FILE parsonConfig.cmake
    NAMESPACE parson::
    DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/cmake/${PROJECT_NAME}
)
```

The build system creates a CMake package configuration file that enables downstream projects to find and use the library through `find_package(parson)`. The namespace "parson::" is applied to exported targets, following modern CMake conventions for target naming.

## Build Goals and Intent

The CMake build system is designed to:
1. **Library Distribution**: Create a redistributable library package suitable for system-wide installation
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support multiple Unix-like systems through GNU standard directories
3. **Modern CMake Integration**: Enable downstream projects to consume the library using modern CMake patterns
4. **Version Management**: Maintain consistent versioning across all build artifacts
5. **Developer Integration**: Provide proper target exports for integration into larger CMake-based projects

## Build Dependencies and Requirements
- CMake version 3.5 or higher
- C compiler supporting C89 standard (implied by source code)
- Unix-like system supporting GNU installation directories

## Build Outputs
- `libparson` library (shared and/or static based on BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)
- `parson.h` header file installed to system include directory
- `parsonConfig.cmake` package configuration file for CMake integration
